# 5 Taking advantage of youth, you party as much as you study. Gain Carouse 1.

# 7: Life Event. Roll on the Life Events table (see page 44).

# 8: You join a political movement. Roll SOC 8+. If successful, you become a
# leading figure. Gain one Ally within the movement but gain one Enemy in
# wider society.

# 9: You develop a healthy interest in a hobby or other area of study.
# Gain any skill of your choice, with the exception of Jack-of-all-Trades,
# at level 0.

## 10: A newly arrived tutor rubs you up the wrong way and you work hard to
##overturn their conclusions. Roll 9+ on any skill you have learned
##during this term. If successful, you provide a truly elegant proof
##that soon becomes accepted as the standard approach. Gain a level
##in the skill you rolled on and the tutor as a Rival.

## 11. War comes and a wide-ranging draft is instigated. You can either flee and
##join the Drifter career next term or be drafted
##(roll 1D: 1-3 Army, 4-5 Marine, 6 Navy). Either way, you do not graduate
##this term. However, if you roll SOC 9+, you can get enough strings pulled
##to avoid the draft and complete your education â€“ you may attempt graduation
##normally and are not drafted.

## 12. You gain wide-ranging recognition of your initiative and innovative
##approach to study. Increase your SOC by +1.
